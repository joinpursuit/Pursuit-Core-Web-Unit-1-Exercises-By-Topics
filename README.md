### 1. [loneTeen](https://codingbat.com/prob/p165701)

We'll say that a number is "teen" if it is in the range 13..19 inclusive. Given 2 int values, return true if one or the other is teen, but not both.

**Function signature**: `loneTeen(numA, numB) → boolean`

**Sample input & output**: 
```
loneTeen(13, 99) → true
loneTeen(21, 19) → true
loneTeen(13, 13) → false
```

### 2. [caughtSpeeding](https://codingbat.com/prob/p157733)

You are driving a little too fast, and a police officer stops you. Write a function `caughtSpeeding` to compute the result, encoded as number value: 0=no ticket, 1=small ticket, 2=big ticket. If speed is 60 or less, the result is 0. If speed is between 61 and 80 inclusive, the result is 1. If speed is 81 or more, the result is 2. Unless it is your birthday -- on that day, your speed can be 5 higher in all cases.

**Function signature**: `caughtSpeeding(speed, isBirthday) → number`

**Sample input & output**: 
```
caughtSpeeding(60, false) → 0
caughtSpeeding(65, false) → 1
caughtSpeeding(65, true) → 0
```
